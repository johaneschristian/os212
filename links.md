1. [What is sed? How are we suppose to use it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACe7aiGczw)\
This link contains a youtube video that discusses the basics of the sed shell command.

Nonetheless, understanding what it is, how it works, or why do we need it might require an extended research through a variety of other resources. This video is one of them as it discusses upon this matter along with the key's usage.
