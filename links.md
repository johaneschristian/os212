1. [What is sed? How are we suppose to use it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACe7aiGczw)
This link contains a youtube video that discusses the basics of the sed shell command. What's interesting about this particular video is that it explains a variety of usage on sed along with its real-life usage example. It also explains the usage that is similar to commands like grep and awk but stresses some usage that can only be completed with the sed command.

2. [Linux Basic Commands](https://linoxide.com/essential-linux-basic-commands/)
This article discusses the usage of 40 Basic Linux Commands. It was the first link that I visit after completing the virtualBox setup. The link is equipped with complete description of the command along with the command example with its expected output.
